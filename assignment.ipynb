Additionally, 8 students in the course will be invited randomly to a brief meeting with the instructor during the course's final exam slot. If you are selected for a brief meeting, we'll spend about 15 minutes during the final exam slot to review your work. This interview will cover coding practices based on your past assignments. It is meant as a checkpoint to ensure that you have internalized the work you submitted.\n"
